# I'm writing this because apparently according to the text, I need to write this script in order to perform proper tribute to the programming gods and ensure I truly learn Perl.
# I'm not a superstitous man, but if there's any god in this universe I just know he'd pull this kind of stuff.

# Not sure why this is in comments, but I'm putting it here since it was in the text. Is it just a helpful header to tell people how to run the program?
# Apparently it's a Unix header to enable warnings.
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
print "Hello, world.\n";
print "I PRAY TO THE PROGRAMMING GODS!\n";      # Not in the tutorial, but it's here for good measure.
